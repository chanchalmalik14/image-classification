# Organic vs Recyclable Waste Classification using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, automated image classification has become highly effective. This project focuses on developing a **machine learning-based image classification system** that can identify whether an object is **organic** or **recyclable** based on its visual characteristics.

The system uses **deep learning techniques**, specifically a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, to extract meaningful features from images and accurately classify waste materials. The goal is to support efficient waste segregation and promote environmental sustainability.
